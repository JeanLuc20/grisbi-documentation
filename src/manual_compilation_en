Grisbi user's manual compilation :


For a complete compilation with images in pdf and html formats, you will have to install a Latex distribution (i.e. texlive) and the hevea and perl packages. Then you have to make sure the extensions called in the grisbi-manual.tex, macros.sty and hva/macros.hva files by the \usepackage command are installed, particulally : babel, translator, url, varioref, picins, caption, macros, bigfoot (ou perpage), fixfoot, xindy, imakeidx, idxlayout, hyperref, glossaries (see the CTAN repository http://ctan.org/).


The compilation is done by the following commands, in the src/ directory:

# compile to PDF format without images:
$ make pdf		

# compile to PDF format without images, with index and glossary: 
$ make pdf_indexglossary ; make pdf

# compile to PDF format with images:
$ make pdf_img		

# compile to PDF format with images, with index and glossary:
$ make pdf_img_indexglossary ; make pdf_img

# compile to HTML format without images, with index:
$ make html		

# compile to HTML format with images, with index:
$ make html_img		


You can clean the src/ directory by removing ALL auxiliary files (.aux, .log, etc.) created by a previous compilation:
$ make clean

Or remove those same files  and ALL files created by the Makefile (which is recommended to do before each compilation):
$ make distclean	


After compilation:
- grisbi-manuel-xxx.pdf file (without images) is located in src/pdf/
- grisbi-manuel-img-xxx.pdf file (with images) is located in src/pdf_img/
- the html files without images are located in src/html/ and in the  archive in src/tgz_html/
- the html files with images are located in src/html_img/ and in the archive in src/tgz_html_img/

In html, the manual is available in two shapes :
- grisbi-manuel.html for the header page with summary and index, with links to the chapters, in as many files as chapters ;
- grisbi-manuel-1page.html for the manual in one page and in one big file.
